Simple JSP Upload is a simple upload application written as a couple
of JSP pages.

You need a Servlet Container to run it, e.g. Apache Tomcat.

Uploaded files are places in a directory called "uploads". On Windows
this directory is asumed to be located in C:\TEMP, on other systems
it's asumed to be in /tmp.

Remember to give write permissions to the uploads directory.
